I needed this basic functionality and couldn't found any similiar addons, so I decided to do it myself. Basically this addon functions same as the "Weapon Override" option in the context menu but it allows you to select multiple weapons instead of one.

**Spawnmenu (Hold Q) > Options > snaileny > NPC Weapon Override Menu**

Enable the addon by checking the "Enabled" checkbox. Double click on the list to select the weapons you want to spawn NPCs with. Weapons you selected are given to NPCs in selection order, however you can randomize the order by checking the "Randomize" checkbox. Adds two console variables:
* npcweaponoverridemenu_enabled
* npcweaponoverridemenu_random
